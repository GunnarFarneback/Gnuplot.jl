The macros accepts any number of arguments, with the following meaning:\n\none, or a group of consecutive, array(s) build up a dataset.  The different arrays are accessible as columns 1, 2, etc. from the gnuplot process.  The number of required input arrays depends on the chosen plot style (see gnuplot documentation);\na string occurring before a dataset is interpreted as a gnuplot command (e.g. set grid);\na string occurring immediately after a dataset is interpreted as a plot element for the dataset, by which you can specify using clause, with clause, line styles, etc..  All keywords may be abbreviated following gnuplot conventions.  Moreover, \"plot\" and \"splot\" can be abbreviated to \"p\" and \"s\" respectively;\nthe special symbol :-, whose meaning is to avoid starting a new plot (if given as first argument), or to avoid immediately running all commands to create the final plot (if given as last argument).  Its purpose is to allow splitting one long statement into multiple (shorter) ones;\nany other symbol is interpreted as a session ID;\nan Int (>= 1) is interpreted as the plot destination in a multi-plot session (this specification applies to subsequent arguments, not previous ones);\nan input in the form \"\\$name\"=>(array1, array2, etc...) is interpreted as a named dataset.  Note that the dataset name must always start with a \"$\";\nan input in the form keyword=value is interpreted as a keyword/value pair.  The accepted keywords and their corresponding gnuplot commands are as follows:\nxrange=[low, high] => \"set xrange [low:high];\nyrange=[low, high] => \"set yrange [low:high];\nzrange=[low, high] => \"set zrange [low:high];\ncbrange=[low, high]=> \"set cbrange[low:high];\nkey=\"...\"  => \"set key ...\";\ntitle=\"...\"  => \"set title \"...\"\";\nxlabel=\"...\" => \"set xlabel \"...\"\";\nylabel=\"...\" => \"set ylabel \"...\"\";\nzlabel=\"...\" => \"set zlabel \"...\"\";\nxlog=true   => set logscale x;\nylog=true   => set logscale y;\nzlog=true   => set logscale z.\n\nAll Keyword names can be abbreviated as long as the resulting name is unambiguous.
