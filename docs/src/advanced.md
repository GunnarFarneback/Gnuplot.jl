# Advanced usage

Here we will show a few advanced techniques for data visualization using **Gnuplot.jl**.


```@setup abc
using Gnuplot
Gnuplot.quitall()
mkpath("assets")
saveas(file) = save(term="pngcairo size 480,360", output="assets/$(file).png")
empty!(Gnuplot.options.init)
Gnuplot.exec("set term unknown")
```


## Named datasets

A dataset may have an associated name whose purpose is to use it multiple times for plotting, while sending it only once to gnuplot. A dataset name must begin with a `$`.

A named dataset is defined as a `Pair{String, Tuple}`, e.g.:
```julia
"\$name" => (1:10,)
```
and can be used as an argument to both `@gp` and `gsp`, e.g.:
```@example abc
x = range(-2pi, stop=2pi, length=100);
y = sin.(x)
name = "\$MyDataSet1"
@gp name=>(x, y) "plot $name w l lc rgb 'black'" "pl $name u 1:(1.5*\$2) w l lc rgb 'red'"
saveas("ex010") # hide
```
![](assets/ex010.png)

Both curves use the same input data, but the red curve has the second column (`\$2`, corresponding to the *y* value) multiplied by a factor 1.5.

A named dataset comes in hand also when using gnuplot to fit experimental data to a model, e.g.:
```@example abc
# Generate data and some noise to simulate measurements
x = range(-2pi, stop=2pi, length=20);
y = 1.5 * sin.(0.3 .+ 0.7x);
err = 0.1 * maximum(abs.(y)) .* fill(1, size(x));
y += err .* randn(length(x));
name = "\$MyDataSet1"

@gp    "f(x) = a * sin(b + c*x)"     :- # define an analytical model
@gp :- "a=1" "b=1" "c=1"             :- # set parameter initial values
@gp :- name=>(x, y, err)             :- # define a named dataset
@gp :- "fit f(x) $name via a, b, c;"    # fit the data
```

The parameter best fit values can be retrieved as follows:
```@example abc
@info("Best fit values:",
a=Gnuplot.exec("print a"),
b=Gnuplot.exec("print b"),
c=Gnuplot.exec("print c"))
```

A named dataset is available until the session is reset, i.e. as long as `:-` is used as first argument to `@gp`.


## Multiplot

**Gnuplot.jl** can draw multiple plots in the same figure by exploiting the `multiplot` command.  Each plot is identified by a positive integer number, which can be used as argument to `@gp` to redirect commands to the appropriate plot.

Continuing previous example we can plot both data and best fit model (in plot `1`) and residuals (in plot `2`):
```@example abc
@gp :- "set multiplot layout 2,1"
@gp :- 1 "p $name w errorbars t 'Data'" 
@gp :-   "p $name u 1:(f(\$1)) w l t 'Best fit model'"
@gp :- 2 "p $name u 1:((f(\$1)-\$2) / \$3):(1) w errorbars t 'Resid. [{/Symbol s}]'"
@gp :-   [extrema(x)...] [0,0] "w l notit dt 2 lc rgb 'black'" # reference line
saveas("ex011") # hide
```
![](assets/ex011.png)

Note that the order of the plots is not relevant, i.e. we would get the same results with:
```julia
@gp :- "set multiplot layout 2,1"
@gp :- 2 "p $name u 1:((f(\$1)-\$2) / \$3):(1) w errorbars t 'Resid. [{/Symbol s}]'"
@gp :-   [extrema(x)...] [0,0] "w l notit dt 2 lc rgb 'black'" # reference line
@gp :- 1 "p $name w errorbars t 'Data'" 
@gp :-   "p $name u 1:(f(\$1)) w l t 'Best fit model'"
```

### Mixing 2D and 3D plots
A multiplot can also mix 2D and 3D plots:

```@example abc
x = y = -10:0.33:10
@gp "set multiplot layout 1,2"

# 2D
@gp :- 1 x sin.(x) ./ x "w l notit"

# 3D
sinc2d(x,y) = sin.(sqrt.(x.^2 + y.^2))./sqrt.(x.^2+y.^2)
fxy = [sinc2d(x,y) for x in x, y in y]
@gsp :- 2 x y fxy "w pm3d notit"
saveas("ex012") # hide
```

## Multiple sessions

**Gnuplot.jl** can handle multiple sessions, i.e. multiple gnuplot processes running simultaneously.  Each session is identified by a symbol.

In order to redirect commands to a specific session simply insert a symbol into your `@gp` or `@gsp` call, e.g.:
```@example abc
@gp :GP1 "plot sin(x)"    # opens first window
@gp :GP2 "plot sin(x)"    # opens secondo window
@gp :- :GP1 "plot cos(x)" # add a plot on first window
```
If the session ID is not specified the `:default` session is considered.

The names of all current sessions can be retrieved with [`session_names()`](@ref):
```@repl abc
println(session_names())
```

To quit a specific session use [`Gnuplot.quit()`](@ref):
```@repl abc
Gnuplot.quit(:GP1)
```
The output value is the exit status of the underlying gnuplot process.

You may also quit all active sessions at once with [`Gnuplot.quitall()`](@ref):
```@repl abc
Gnuplot.quitall()
```
