# Examples

The official gallery of high quality examples is maintained in a separate repository:

[https://lazarusa.github.io/gnuplot-examples/](https://lazarusa.github.io/gnuplot-examples/)

The examples in this documentation are intentionally very simple, in order to focus on the package functionalities.  The only relatively complex, publication-quality plot, is discussed in [The `cairolatex` terminal](@ref) section.

Keep in mind that **Gnuplot.jl** is just an interface to gnuplot, so everything you can do with the latter is achievable from Julia.
Further gnuplot examples can be found here:
